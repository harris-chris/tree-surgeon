= Tree Surgeon
:toc:

Tree surgeon is a tool for filtering file trees. Filtering expressions are defined via a mini-language, and can then be applied to directories. For example:

- remove files from an existing tree
- copy a directory filtered
- show comparative
- create .gitignore (probably doesn't need to be special)
